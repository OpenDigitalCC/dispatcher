# Dispatcher - Logging Reference

This document is the authoritative reference for every structured log line
emitted by `ctrl-exec` and `ctrl-exec-agent`. It is intended for operators
building log pipelines, alerting rules, SIEM integrations, or audit tooling.

For configuration reference, see REFERENCE.md. For alerting recommendations
and security-relevant actions, see SECURITY-OPERATIONS.md.


## Format Overview

Both binaries emit structured log lines as `key=value` pairs to syslog via
`Sys::Syslog`, using the `daemon` facility. `ACTION=` always appears first.
Remaining fields are in definition order for the emitting code path; their
presence varies by action.

Example lines as they appear in syslog:

```
Mar 13 12:00:01 host ctrl-exec[12345]: ACTION=dispatch SCRIPT=backup HOSTS=db-01,db-02 REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001
Mar 13 12:00:02 host ctrl-exec-agent[6789]: ACTION=run SCRIPT=backup EXIT=0 PEER=10.0.0.1 REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001
```

Syslog tag
: `ctrl-exec` for lines from the `ctrl-exec` binary and `ctrl-exec-api`.
  `ctrl-exec-agent` for lines from `ctrl-exec-agent`.

Facility
: `daemon` (numeric 3). Priority is `daemon.info`, `daemon.warning`, or
  `daemon.err` depending on severity.

`ACTION=`
: Always first. Identifies the event type. Every other field is
  action-specific.

`REQID=`
: A 16-character lowercase hex string generated per dispatch operation by
  `Engine::gen_reqid()`. The same REQID appears in both the ctrl-exec log
  and the corresponding agent log, making cross-host correlation possible
  with a single grep. Not present on all actions — see per-action field
  lists below.


## REQID Correlation

To trace a single operation across both sides:

```bash
grep 'REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001' /var/log/syslog
```

On the ctrl-exec side, `ACTION=dispatch` is logged at the start of a
multi-host operation with a shared REQID. Each per-host `ACTION=run` or
`ACTION=ping` uses the same REQID. On the agent side, `ACTION=run` and
`ACTION=ping` are logged with the same REQID when the operation completes.

There is no `ACTION=run` entry on the agent side at the start of script
execution — only at completion. If the ctrl-exec's `read_timeout` fires
before the script exits, the ctrl-exec logs an error, but no agent log
entry appears until the script eventually exits. An operator cannot
determine from syslog alone that a script is currently running.


## Dispatcher-Side Actions

These actions are emitted by `bin/ctrl-exec` and `bin/ctrl-exec-api` via
`Exec::Engine`, `Exec::Auth`, `Exec::Lock`, and
`Exec::Log`.

### dispatch

| ACTION | string | `dispatch` |
| SCRIPT | string | Script name from the allowlist |
| HOSTS | string | Comma-separated list of target host strings |
| REQID | hex | Request ID shared across all per-host operations |

```
ACTION=dispatch SCRIPT=backup HOSTS=db-01,db-02 REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001
```

### ping (success)

Emitted on successful response to a `/ping` request to one agent.

```

For a multi-host dispatch, one `lock-acquire` entry is emitted per host
locked. A dispatch to `db-01` and `db-02` produces two `lock-acquire`
lines. The corresponding `lock-release` names all released hosts in a
single entry.

### lock-release

`RTT` in place of `ERROR`.

### auth (ctrl-exec-side)

The ctrl-exec-side auth hook is called before every `run` and `ping`
operation. Results are logged by `Exec::Auth`. All variants use the
`auth` action.

These actions are emitted by `bin/ctrl-exec-api` via `Exec::API`
under the syslog tag `ctrl-exec`.

### api-start

Emitted once when `ctrl-exec-api` starts and the HTTP server is ready.

Priority

```
ACTION=api-start PORT=7445 BIND=127.0.0.1 TLS=no
```

| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `api-stop` |

```
ACTION=api-stop
```

### api-request

Emitted for every incoming HTTP request, before auth is evaluated.

Priority
: INFO

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `api-request` |
| METHOD | string | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`) |
| PATH | string | Request path (e.g. `/run`, `/ping`) |
| PEER | string | Source IP of the caller |
| LEN | integer | `Content-Length` of the request body (0 for GET) |

```
ACTION=api-request METHOD=POST PATH=/run PEER=127.0.0.1 LEN=87
```

### run-store-fail

Emitted when the result of a `/run` operation cannot be written to the
result store at `/var/lib/ctrl-exec/runs/`. The run itself succeeded;
only the stored result for `GET /status/{reqid}` is unavailable.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `run-store-fail` |
| REQID | hex | Request ID of the affected run |
| ERROR | string | Error description |

```
ACTION=run-store-fail REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001 ERROR="No space left on device"
```


## Agent-Side Actions

These actions are emitted by `bin/ctrl-exec-agent` and the modules it
calls: `Exec::Auth`, `Exec::Agent::Config`,
`Exec::Agent::RateLimit`, and `Exec::Agent::Runner`.

### start

Emitted once when the agent starts and begins listening.

Priority
: INFO

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `start` |
| PORT | integer | Port the agent is listening on |

```
ACTION=start PORT=7443
```

### ping (agent-side)

Emitted on each successful `/ping` request received and processed by the
agent.

Priority
: INFO

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `ping` |
| PEER | string | IP address of the connecting ctrl-exec |
| REQID | hex | Request ID from the ctrl-exec |

```
ACTION=ping PEER=10.0.0.1 REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001
```

### run (agent-side)

Emitted when a script exits. Logged at script completion, not at the start
of execution.

Priority
: INFO

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `run` |
| SCRIPT | string | Script name from the allowlist |
| EXIT | integer | Script exit code |
| PEER | string | IP address of the connecting ctrl-exec |
| REQID | hex | Request ID from the ctrl-exec |

```
ACTION=run SCRIPT=backup EXIT=0 PEER=10.0.0.1 REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001
```

A non-zero `EXIT` value is still logged at INFO priority — the agent
reports what the script returned, not whether the operator considers it a
failure. Alert on the `EXIT` value itself, not on the priority level. The
agent-side log is the authoritative source for exit codes; the
ctrl-exec-side `run` entry may show a transport-level error in the
`ERROR` field instead of the script's exit code if the connection was
interrupted.

### auth (agent-side)

The agent-side auth hook is called after allowlist validation on every
`/run` request. The same action name and field structure as the
ctrl-exec-side auth log. See the auth description under Dispatcher-Side
Actions for the full field and variant reference.

On the agent side:

- `AUTHACTION` is always `run` (the agent hook is not called for `/ping`)
- `IP` is the ctrl-exec's source IP, not `127.0.0.1`
- `REASON=no-hook-cli` does not occur — the agent has no CLI caller path

### deny

Emitted when a `/run` request is rejected. Two distinct causes produce this
action: the script name is not in the allowlist, or the agent-side auth
hook denied the request.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `deny` |
| SCRIPT | string | Script name from the request |
| PEER | string | IP address of the connecting ctrl-exec |
| REQID | hex | Request ID |
| REASON | string | Present only when denied by auth hook; contains the hook denial reason |

Allowlist denial (no REASON field):

```
ACTION=deny SCRIPT=unknown-script PEER=10.0.0.1 REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001
```

Auth hook denial (REASON field present):

```
ACTION=deny REASON=denied SCRIPT=backup PEER=10.0.0.1 REQID=a1b2c3d4e5f60001
```

To distinguish between the two in log processing: allowlist denials have
no REASON field; hook denials always have one.

### serial-reject

Emitted when the ctrl-exec's cert serial does not match the stored value
on the agent. Applied to both `/run` and `/ping` requests.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `serial-reject` |
| PEER | string | IP address of the connecting host |
| REQID | hex | Request ID, or `(none)` if not yet read from the request body |

```
ACTION=serial-reject PEER=10.0.0.1 REQID=(none)
```

This should not occur during normal operation after a complete rotation
broadcast. Treat as a security signal requiring investigation.

### revoked-cert

Emitted when a connecting peer presents a certificate whose serial appears
in the agent's revocation list (`revoked_serials`).

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `revoked-cert` |
| PEER | string | IP address of the connecting host |
| SERIAL | string | Lowercase hex serial of the revoked cert |

```
ACTION=revoked-cert PEER=10.0.0.1 SERIAL=deadbeef01234567
```

### tls-failure

Emitted when a TLS handshake fails. The peer may be an unauthenticated
host, a host with an expired cert, or a host whose cert was not signed by
the deployment CA.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `tls-failure` |
| PEER | string | IP address of the connecting host (pre-handshake) |
| REASON | string | SSL error string from `IO::Socket::SSL` |

```
ACTION=tls-failure PEER=203.0.113.5 REASON="SSL accept attempt failed error:..."
```

TLS failures also update the probe rate counter for the peer IP. If the
probe threshold is crossed, a subsequent `rate-block` is emitted.

### accept-fatal

Emitted when the server socket's `accept()` call returns a fatal error
(not a TLS handshake failure). A fatal accept error causes the agent's
main loop to exit.

Priority
: ERR

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `accept-fatal` |
| PEER | string | Peer address at point of failure, or `unknown` |
| REASON | string | System error string from `$!` |

```
ACTION=accept-fatal PEER=unknown REASON="Bad file descriptor"
```

### ip-block

Emitted when a connecting IP is not in the `allowed_ips` list configured
in `agent.conf`. The connection is dropped before the TLS handshake.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `ip-block` |
| PEER | string | IP address of the blocked connection |

```
ACTION=ip-block PEER=203.0.113.5
```

### rate-block

Emitted when a source IP is blocked by the volume or probe rate limiter.
One entry is logged when the threshold is first crossed; subsequent
connections from the same IP during the block window are silently dropped
without additional log entries.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `rate-block` |
| PEER | string | IP address of the blocked source |
| REASON | string | `volume` or `probe` |

```
ACTION=rate-block PEER=10.0.0.1 REASON=volume
ACTION=rate-block PEER=10.0.0.1 REASON=probe
```

Volume threshold: more than `rate_limit_volume` connections within the
volume window. Default: 10 connections in 60 seconds, 5-minute block.

Probe threshold: more than `rate_limit_probe` TLS handshake failures within
the probe window. Default: 3 failures in 600 seconds, 1-hour block.

### rate-evict

Emitted when an entry is removed from the in-memory rate limit table to
make room for a new source IP (LRU eviction). The rate limit table has a
maximum of 1000 entries. The evicted entry is the one with the earliest
`blocked_until` timestamp (or no block at all).

Priority
: INFO

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `rate-evict` |
| COUNT | integer | The table capacity ceiling that triggered eviction (always 1000) |

```

| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `capabilities-deny` |
| PEER | string | IP address of the connecting host |
| PEER_SERIAL | string | Serial of the connecting cert |

| PEER | string | IP address |
| REASON | string | Hook denial reason |

```
ACTION=capabilities-deny PEER=10.0.0.1 PEER_SERIAL=deadbeef REASON=serial-mismatch
ACTION=capabilities-deny PEER=10.0.0.1 REASON=denied
```

### capabilities-no-serial

Emitted when the agent has no stored ctrl-exec serial and the serial check
on `/capabilities` is therefore skipped. The request proceeds but the
restriction is not enforced.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `capabilities-no-serial` |
| PEER | string | IP address |
| REASON | string | `no ctrl-exec serial stored - re-pair to enable restriction` |

```
ACTION=capabilities-no-serial PEER=10.0.0.1 REASON="no ctrl-exec serial stored - re-pair to enable restriction"
```

Re-pair the agent to write the ctrl-exec serial and enable the restriction.

### capabilities (agent-side, success)

Emitted in background pairing mode when the timeout expires before approval
arrives.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `pair-timeout` |
| REQID | hex | Pairing request ID |

```
ACTION=pair-timeout REQID=00c9845e0001
```

### config-warn

Emitted at startup (or SIGHUP reload) when `agent.conf` or `scripts.conf`
contains an entry that is invalid but non-fatal. The problematic entry is
skipped and loading continues.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `config-warn` |
| ENTRY or KEY | string | The offending entry or config key |
| MSG | string | Description of the problem |

Two variants:

`allowed_ips` entry with an unsupported CIDR prefix length:

```
ACTION=config-warn ENTRY=10.0.0.0/20 MSG="unsupported prefix length"
```

`rate_limit_volume` or `rate_limit_probe` with invalid format:

```
ACTION=config-warn KEY=rate_limit_volume MSG="invalid format, expected limit/window/block - using defaults"
```

### stdin-timeout

Emitted when the agent times out writing the JSON context to a script's
stdin pipe. The script did not consume the pipe buffer within
`stdin_timeout` seconds (default 10). The write end is closed, delivering
EOF to the script. The script continues running.

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `stdin-timeout` |
| BYTES | integer | Number of bytes that were not written at timeout |

```
ACTION=stdin-timeout BYTES=1024
```

Occasional occurrences from scripts that discard stdin are harmless.
Repeated occurrences from the same script indicate the script is hanging
before reading stdin or the context payload is unusually large.

### revoked-serials-absent

Emitted at agent startup when the file specified by `revoked_serials` in
`agent.conf` does not exist. The agent proceeds normally, treating the
absent file as an empty revocation list.

Priority
: INFO

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `revoked-serials-absent` |
| PATH | string | The configured path that was not found |
| REASON | string | `file not found - no serials revoked` |

```
ACTION=revoked-serials-absent PATH=/etc/ctrl-exec-agent/revoked-serials REASON="file not found - no serials revoked"
```

This is informational. An absent file is the expected state on a freshly
paired agent. `config-warn` is produced only for malformed entries within
the file if it does exist.


## Rotation Actions

These actions are emitted by `Exec::Rotation` under the syslog tag
`ctrl-exec`. They cover the ctrl-exec cert lifecycle: expiry checking,
rotation, and serial broadcast to agents.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACTION | string | `serial-confirmed` |
| AGENT | string | Hostname of the confirming agent |

```
ACTION=serial-confirmed AGENT=web-01

### serial-broadcast-fail

Emitted for each agent where the serial broadcast attempt fails (non-zero
exit from `update-ctrl-exec-serial` or connection error).

Priority
: WARNING

Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| AGENT | string | Hostname of the agent that could not be reached |
| ERROR | string | Error description or exit code |

```
ACTION=serial-broadcast-fail AGENT=db-02 ERROR="exit 1"
```

## Alert Pattern Reference

The following patterns are recommended starting points for alerting rules.
Match against the `ACTION=` field after the syslog tag. For normal monitoring,
filter to WARNING and ERR priority and reserve INFO for REQID-based audit
traces — high-volume fleets will see significant INFO traffic from `run`,
`ping`, and `dispatch` on every operation.

Security events

| Pattern | Meaning | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACTION=rate-block REASON=volume` | Source IP exceeded connection volume threshold | Investigate source IP; sustained occurrences indicate scanning or connection flooding |
| `ACTION=rate-block REASON=probe` | Source IP exceeded TLS handshake failure threshold | Investigate source IP; consistent probe failures indicate certificate probing or brute-force attempts |
| `ACTION=serial-reject` | Dispatcher cert serial mismatch on agent | Check rotation broadcast status; run `ctrl-exec serial-status`; should not occur during normal post-rotation operation |
| `ACTION=revoked-cert` | Revoked cert presented to agent | Treat as a security event; investigate source IP immediately |
| `ACTION=ip-block` | Connection from IP outside `allowed_ips` | Review `allowed_ips` config; unexpected occurrences indicate traffic from an unrecognised source |
| `ACTION=deny` (repeated, same PEER) | Script not in allowlist or hook denying repeatedly | Check agent allowlist; may indicate misconfiguration or probing for available scripts |
| `ACTION=capabilities-deny REASON=serial-mismatch` | Capabilities restricted by serial check failing | Check rotation state via `ctrl-exec serial-status`; re-pair if serial is permanently stale |

Execution failures

| Pattern | Meaning | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACTION=run EXIT=<non-zero>` (agent-side) | Script exited with a failure code | The non-zero exit is logged at INFO priority on both sides; correlate with REQID to find output; check script behaviour |
| `ACTION=run ERROR=` (ctrl-exec-side) | Dispatcher could not reach agent or parse response | Check agent reachability and cert validity |
| `ACTION=ping ERROR=` | Ping failed | Agent unreachable or cert issue; cert renewal will not trigger until ping succeeds |
| `ACTION=renew ERROR=` | Cert renewal failed | Check agent connectivity; cert will expire if renewals continue to fail |
| `ACTION=cert-rotation-fail` | Dispatcher cert rotation failed | Investigate immediately; rotation retried on next check interval |

Rotation events

| Pattern | Meaning | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACTION=serial-broadcast-fail` (for same AGENT, repeated) | Agent not receiving serial update | Check agent connectivity; agent will be marked stale after overlap window expires |
| `ACTION=serial-stale` | Agent overlap window expired without confirmation | Re-pair the agent; it will reject `/capabilities` from the current ctrl-exec cert until re-paired |
| `ACTION=rotation-state-corrupt` | `rotation.json` unreadable | Manual intervention required; rotation state must be restored before the next rotation attempt |
| All agents `ACTION=serial-reject` simultaneously after rotation | Rotation broadcast failed or cert not synced across HA nodes | Run `ctrl-exec serial-status` and `ctrl-exec rotate-cert` immediately |

Configuration problems

| Pattern | Meaning | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACTION=config-warn` | Invalid config entry at load time | Review `agent.conf`; fix or remove the offending entry; should not occur in a healthy deployment after initial setup |
| `ACTION=accept-fatal` | Agent main loop exiting | Agent will stop serving; investigate and restart immediately |
| `ACTION=auth RESULT=error REASON=hook-not-executable` | Auth hook missing or not executable | Fix hook path and permissions; all requests are failing until resolved |
| `ACTION=capabilities-no-serial` | Agent lacks stored ctrl-exec serial | Re-pair agent to enable serial-based restriction on `/capabilities` |
| `ACTION=run-store-fail` | API result cannot be stored | Check disk space on ctrl-exec host; `GET /status/{reqid}` will return 404 for affected requests |

Pairing events

| Pattern | Meaning | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACTION=pair-approve` | Operator approved a pairing request | Informational; confirm expected agent if unattended |
| `ACTION=pair-complete` | Agent stored the signed cert | Informational; confirm expected if unattended pairing |
| `ACTION=pair-denied` (agent-side) | Pairing request denied | Confirm intentional; re-run `request-pairing` if denial was in error |
| `ACTION=pair-timeout` | Pairing approval window expired | Re-run `request-pairing`; increase `--timeout` if approval latency is high |
| `ACTION=pair-reject REASON=queue-full` | Pairing queue at capacity | Review pending requests via `ctrl-exec list-requests`; deny stale entries to free queue |
| `ACTION=stdin-timeout` (repeated, same SCRIPT) | Script not consuming stdin context | Review script startup behaviour; add `exec 0</dev/null` if stdin is not needed, or increase `stdin_timeout` in `agent.conf` |
