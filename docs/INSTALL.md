# ctrl-exec - Installation and Operations


## Platform Requirements

Supported platforms:

Debian / Ubuntu
: `apt` package manager, systemd for service management. All Perl dependencies
  available as system packages - no CPAN required.

Alpine Linux
: `apk` package manager. No systemd - services run directly or in Docker.
  See `DOCKER.md` for container deployment.

The installer detects the platform automatically and uses the correct package
names and commands. For RPM-based systems (RHEL, Rocky, Alma), install
dependencies manually and copy files according to the file layout in
`DEVELOPER.md`.


## Dependencies

Agent (`--agent`)

- Debian: `libio-socket-ssl-perl`, `libjson-perl`
- Alpine: `perl-io-socket-ssl`, `perl-json`

ctrl-exec (`--ctrl-exec`)

- Debian: `libwww-perl`, `libio-socket-ssl-perl`, `libjson-perl`
- Alpine: `perl-libwww`, `perl-io-socket-ssl`, `perl-json`

API (`--api`)
: No additional packages beyond the ctrl-exec role.

All roles require `openssl` (present on any standard installation) and `perl`.

The installer checks all dependencies before making any changes and prints the
correct install command if anything is missing.


## Installation

The installer must be run as root. A role must be specified.

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --agent        # on each remote host
sudo ./install.sh --ctrl-exec   # on the control host
sudo ./install.sh --api          # on the control host, after --ctrl-exec
sudo ./install.sh --uninstall    # remove files (preserves config and certs)
sudo ./install.sh --run-tests    # run test suite from source directory
```

`--run-tests` may be combined with a role flag to run tests after installation,
or used alone to test without installing.

### Installed paths

```
/usr/local/bin/ctrl-exec
/usr/local/bin/ctrl-exec-agent
/usr/local/bin/ctrl-exec-api
/usr/local/lib/ctrl-exec/          Perl library modules
/etc/ctrl-exec/                    ctrl-exec config, CA material, auth hook
/etc/ctrl-exec-agent/              Agent config and certs
/opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/            Managed scripts on agent hosts
/var/lib/ctrl-exec/pairing/        Pending pairing requests
/var/lib/ctrl-exec/agents/         Agent registry
/var/lib/ctrl-exec/locks/          Concurrency lock files (transient)
/etc/systemd/system/ctrl-exec-agent.service   (systemd platforms only)
/etc/systemd/system/ctrl-exec-api.service     (systemd platforms only)
```

The installer stamps the release version from the `VERSION` file into the three
binaries at install time. The source files in the distribution carry the
sentinel value `UNINSTALLED` until the installer runs. After installation,
`ctrl-exec --version` reports the version of the release that was installed.

### ctrl-exec group

The installer creates a `ctrl-exec` system group. Add yourself to it for
CLI access without sudo:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG ctrl-exec $USER
# Log out and back in for the group to take effect
```


## Running the Tests

Run from the project root before or after installing:

```bash
prove -Ilib t/
```

Or via the installer:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --agent --run-tests
```

`t/lock.t` requires `t/lock-holder.pl` to be present alongside it.
`t/auth.t` and `t/pairing-ctrl-exec.t` require `libjson-perl` / `perl-json`
and are skipped automatically if not available.


## Initial Setup

### 1. ctrl-exec host - CA and certificates

Initialise the CA (once only - do not repeat on an existing installation):

```bash
sudo ctrl-exec setup-ca
```

Generate the ctrl-exec's own certificate:

```bash
sudo ctrl-exec setup-ctrl-exec
```

Both commands write to `/etc/ctrl-exec/`. The CA private key (`ca.key`) is
set 0600 and must not leave this host. Back it up to encrypted offline storage.

### 2. Configure the ctrl-exec

Edit `/etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.conf`:

```ini
port      = 7443
cert      = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.crt
key       = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.key
ca        = /etc/ctrl-exec/ca.crt
auth_hook = /etc/ctrl-exec/auth-hook

# Cert lifetime for new and renewed agent certs (days)
cert_days = 365
```

`auth_hook` is optional. Remove or comment it out to authorise all requests
unconditionally. Appropriate for isolated networks; not recommended for
production deployments accessible from outside.

### 3. Agent host - configure before pairing

Edit `/etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.conf`:

```ini
port = 7443
cert = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.crt
key  = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.key
ca   = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/ca.crt

# Restrict scripts to approved directories (recommended)
script_dirs = /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts

# Optional: agent-side auth hook for independent token validation
# auth_hook = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/auth-hook

# Optional tags - reported in discovery responses
[tags]
env  = prod
role = db
site = london
```

Edit the allowlist `/etc/ctrl-exec-agent/scripts.conf`:

```ini
# name = /absolute/path/to/script
backup-mysql  = /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/backup-mysql.sh
check-disk    = /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/check-disk.sh
```

Place scripts in the managed directory:

```bash
sudo cp your-script.sh /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/
sudo chmod 750 /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/your-script.sh
sudo chown root:ctrl-exec-agent /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/your-script.sh
```

### 4. Pairing

On the ctrl-exec host, start pairing mode:

```bash
sudo ctrl-exec pairing-mode
```

This blocks until interrupted. When run in a terminal it is interactive -
incoming requests are displayed immediately and you are prompted to approve
or deny.

On the agent host:

```bash
sudo ctrl-exec-agent request-pairing --dispatcher <ctrl-exec-hostname>
```

The agent connects and waits. A prompt appears in the pairing mode terminal:

```
Pairing request from agent-host-01 (192.0.2.10) - ID: 00c9845e0001
  Received: 2026-03-05T18:38:09Z
Accept, Deny, or Skip? [a/d/s]:
```

Type `a` to approve. The agent stores its cert and exits. Press Ctrl-C to
stop pairing mode.

If multiple requests arrive simultaneously they are numbered:

```
1. agent-host-01 (192.0.2.10) - ID: 00c9845e0001 - 2026-03-05T18:38:09Z
2. prod-db-01  (192.0.2.12) - ID: 1a4f2e330001 - 2026-03-05T18:38:22Z
Command (a1/d1/a2/d2/list/quit):
```

Use `a1`, `d2` etc. to act individually, `list` to redisplay, `quit` to exit.

For non-interactive use (scripted or from a service), use separate commands
from another terminal while pairing mode runs:

```bash
ctrl-exec list-requests
ctrl-exec approve <reqid>
ctrl-exec deny <reqid>
```

Confirm the agent is registered:

```bash
ctrl-exec list-agents
```

### 5. Start the agent

On systemd platforms:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ctrl-exec-agent
sudo systemctl start ctrl-exec-agent
sudo systemctl status ctrl-exec-agent
```

On Alpine or without systemd:

```bash
ctrl-exec-agent serve
```

### 6. Verify from the ctrl-exec

On the agent host, confirm the agent is listening and enforcing policy
correctly with a loopback test:

```bash
sudo ctrl-exec-agent self-ping
```

`self-ping` connects to `127.0.0.1:7443`, completes the mTLS handshake,
and sends a ping. The agent responds with 403 serial mismatch — the
correct behaviour, since the agent's own cert is not a ctrl-exec cert.
A successful `self-ping` confirms the port is listening, TLS is working,
and the agent is enforcing serial policy.

Then verify from the ctrl-exec host:

```bash
ctrl-exec ping <agent-hostname>
```

Expected output:

```
HOST             STATUS    RTT    CERT EXPIRY                   VERSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
agent-hostname   ok        45ms   Jun  7 16:28:00 2027 GMT      0.1
```

### 7. Start the API server (optional)

On systemd platforms:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ctrl-exec-api
sudo systemctl start ctrl-exec-api
```

On Alpine or without systemd:

```bash
ctrl-exec-api
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:7445/health | python3 -m json.tool
```


## CLI Reference

### Run

```bash
# Run a script on one host
ctrl-exec run host-a backup-mysql

# With arguments (everything after -- is passed to the script)
ctrl-exec run host-a logger -- -t my-tag "hello from ctrl-exec"

# Multiple hosts in parallel
ctrl-exec run host-a host-b host-c check-disk

# Custom port on one host
ctrl-exec run host-a:7450 host-b backup-mysql

# JSON output
ctrl-exec run host-a backup-mysql --json

# With auth token (preferred: via environment, does not appear in ps)
ENVEXEC_TOKEN=mytoken ctrl-exec run host-a backup-mysql
ctrl-exec run host-a backup-mysql --token mytoken --username deploy
```

### Ping

```bash
ctrl-exec ping host-a
ctrl-exec ping host-a host-b host-c
ctrl-exec ping host-a --json
```

### Agent management

```bash
ctrl-exec list-agents                  # all paired agents with cert expiry
ctrl-exec list-requests                # pending pairing requests
ctrl-exec approve <reqid>              # approve a pairing request
ctrl-exec deny <reqid>                 # deny a pairing request
ctrl-exec unpair <hostname>            # remove agent from registry
```

`unpair` removes the registry entry. The agent cert remains valid until its
natural expiry - decommission the host promptly.


## API Reference

The API server listens on port 7445. All bodies are JSON with
`Content-Type: application/json`.

### Endpoints

`GET /health`
: Liveness check. No auth. Returns `{ "ok": true, "version": "0.1" }`.

`POST /ping`
: Body: `{ "hosts": [...], "username": "...", "token": "..." }`.
  Returns `{ "ok": true, "results": [...] }`.

`POST /run`
: Body: `{ "hosts": [...], "script": "...", "args": [...], "username": "...", "token": "..." }`.
  Returns `{ "ok": true, "results": [...] }`.

`GET /discovery` or `POST /discovery`
: Optional body: `{ "hosts": [...] }`. If hosts omitted, queries all registered
  agents. Returns `{ "ok": true, "hosts": { hostname: { scripts, tags, ... } } }`.

### HTTP status codes

```
200   Success
400   Bad request
403   Auth denied
404   Unknown endpoint
409   Lock conflict (script already running on host)
500   Server error
```

### Examples

```bash
# Ping
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:7445/ping \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"hosts":["agent-host-01"]}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Run
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:7445/run \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"hosts":["agent-host-01"],"script":"backup-mysql","args":["--db","myapp"]}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool

# Discovery
curl -s http://localhost:7445/discovery | python3 -m json.tool
```

### API TLS

Add to `/etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.conf`:

```ini
api_cert = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.crt
api_key  = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.key
```

Restart the API service. Clients use `--cacert /etc/ctrl-exec/ca.crt` or a
certificate from a public CA if clients do not have the private CA cert.


## Auth Hook

The auth hook is called before every `run` and `ping` from both CLI and API.
It is the sole policy engine - ctrl-exec has no built-in ACLs.

The hook receives request context as environment variables and as a JSON object
on stdin. Tokens and usernames are forwarded through to agent hooks and to
scripts via JSON stdin, enabling token validation at every stage of an
execution pipeline.

### Environment variables

```
ENVEXEC_ACTION      run | ping
ENVEXEC_SCRIPT      script name (empty for ping)
ENVEXEC_HOSTS       comma-separated host list
ENVEXEC_ARGS        space-joined args (ambiguous if args contain spaces)
ENVEXEC_ARGS_JSON   args as a JSON array string (use this for arg inspection)
ENVEXEC_USERNAME    username from request (may be empty)
ENVEXEC_TOKEN       token from request (may be empty)
ENVEXEC_SOURCE_IP   127.0.0.1 for CLI, caller IP for API
ENVEXEC_TIMESTAMP   ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
```

### Exit codes

```
0   authorised
1   denied - generic
2   denied - bad credentials
3   denied - insufficient privilege
```

The hook must not produce output. Use syslog for audit logging.

### Examples

Static token check:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
[[ "$ENVEXEC_TOKEN" == "mysecrettoken" ]] || exit 2
exit 0
```

Per-token script restriction:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
case "$ENVEXEC_TOKEN" in
    backup-token)
        [[ "$ENVEXEC_SCRIPT" == backup-* ]] || exit 3
        exit 0 ;;
    ops-token)
        exit 0 ;;
    *)
        exit 2 ;;
esac
```

Argument count check using `ENVEXEC_ARGS_JSON`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ARG_COUNT=$(echo "$ENVEXEC_ARGS_JSON" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)))")
[[ "$ARG_COUNT" -le 2 ]] || exit 3
exit 0
```

### Agent-side auth hook

Agents can also run an auth hook, configured via `auth_hook` in `agent.conf`.
This runs after allowlist validation and receives the same context including
token and username forwarded from the ctrl-exec. Useful for independent token
validation in zero-trust or multi-ctrl-exec deployments.


## Configuration Reference

### `/etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.conf`

```ini
port      = 7443                          # mTLS port agents connect to
cert      = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.crt
key       = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.key
ca        = /etc/ctrl-exec/ca.crt
auth_hook = /etc/ctrl-exec/auth-hook     # optional
api_port  = 7445                          # API server port
api_cert  = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.crt  # optional, enables TLS on API
api_key   = /etc/ctrl-exec/ctrl-exec.key  # optional
cert_days = 365                           # lifetime for new/renewed agent certs
```

### `/etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.conf`

```ini
port = 7443
cert = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.crt
key  = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.key
ca   = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/ca.crt

# Colon-separated list of approved script directories (optional)
script_dirs = /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts

# Agent-side auth hook executable (optional)
# auth_hook = /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/auth-hook

# Pairing port (default: 7444)
# pairing_port = 7444

# Restrict connections to known ctrl-exec IPs (optional)
# allowed_ips = 192.168.1.10, 10.0.0.0/8

# Rate limiting (defaults shown - omit to use defaults)
# rate_limit_volume = 10/60/300
# rate_limit_probe  = 3/600/3600
# rate_limit_disable = 1   # disable for testing only

[tags]
env  = prod
role = db
site = london
```

### `/etc/ctrl-exec-agent/scripts.conf`

```ini
# name = /absolute/path/to/script
backup-mysql  = /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/backup-mysql.sh
check-disk    = /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/check-disk.sh
```


## Adding Scripts to an Agent

```bash
sudo cp check-disk.sh /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/
sudo chmod 750 /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/check-disk.sh
sudo chown root:ctrl-exec-agent /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/check-disk.sh

echo "check-disk = /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts/check-disk.sh" \
    | sudo tee -a /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/scripts.conf

# Reload without restart
sudo systemctl kill --signal=HUP ctrl-exec-agent
```

Scripts receive positional arguments as passed. They should exit 0 on success,
non-zero on failure. stdout and stderr are both captured and returned.

Full request context (script name, args, reqid, peer IP, username, token,
timestamp) is also piped to the script as a JSON object on stdin. Scripts that
do not need it can redirect stdin: add `exec 0</dev/null` at the top of the
script.

### Script permissions and privilege

The agent process runs as root by default. Scripts that should not run as root
can drop privileges explicitly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
exec sudo -u appuser /usr/local/bin/my-script.sh "$@"
```

Add a targeted sudoers rule:

```
ctrl-exec-agent ALL=(appuser) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/my-script.sh
```

This hands privilege management to `sudo`, which has exactly that job.


## Automatic Cert Renewal

Renewal is triggered automatically after every successful ping when remaining
cert validity is less than half the configured `cert_days`. With the default
365 days, renewal begins at approximately 182 days remaining.

No operator action is needed during normal operation. To check cert status:

```bash
# On the agent host
sudo ctrl-exec-agent pairing-status

# From the ctrl-exec (CERT EXPIRY column)
ctrl-exec ping host-a host-b
```

Renewal failure is logged at ERR level on the ctrl-exec and retried on the
next ping. A cert that fails repeatedly will eventually expire and require
re-pairing.

To change cert lifetime, update `cert_days` in `ctrl-exec.conf`. Existing
certs are unaffected until their next renewal.


## ctrl-exec Redundancy

Two ctrl-exec installations can share a CA and manage the same agent fleet
independently. Each ctrl-exec signs certs and maintains its own registry.
Agents accept connections from any ctrl-exec that shares the CA.

On the primary ctrl-exec after `setup-ca` and `setup-ctrl-exec`:

```bash
# Transfer CA material to secondary over a secure channel
sudo scp /etc/ctrl-exec/ca.key root@secondary:/etc/ctrl-exec/ca.key
sudo scp /etc/ctrl-exec/ca.crt root@secondary:/etc/ctrl-exec/ca.crt
```

On the secondary:

```bash
sudo ctrl-exec setup-ctrl-exec
```

Each ctrl-exec then pairs with agents independently. Agents must pair with
each ctrl-exec separately. This is active-active with independent registries -
registry synchronisation is an operational responsibility.


## Reloading and Restarting

Agent config and allowlist reload without downtime:

```bash
sudo systemctl kill --signal=HUP ctrl-exec-agent
# or on Alpine/non-systemd: kill -HUP <pid>
```

Reloads `agent.conf` and `scripts.conf` including `script_dirs`, `auth_hook`,
and `[tags]`. Changes take effect for subsequent requests.

Restart agent (drops in-flight connections):

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ctrl-exec-agent
```

Restart API server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ctrl-exec-api
```


## Troubleshooting

Agent unreachable after pairing
: Check the service is running: `systemctl status ctrl-exec-agent`.
  Check port 7443 is open: `ss -tlnp | grep 7443`.
  Verify cert: `sudo ctrl-exec-agent pairing-status`.

Connection refused
: The agent service is not running. `sudo systemctl start ctrl-exec-agent`.

SSL handshake failure
: Cert or CA mismatch. Re-pair the agent.

Script not found
: Check `scripts.conf` - path must be absolute and the file must be executable
  by the `ctrl-exec-agent` user. Check syslog for `ACTION=deny` lines.
  If `script_dirs` is set, confirm the path is under an approved directory.

Auth denied unexpectedly
: Confirm `auth_hook` is absent or commented out in `ctrl-exec.conf` if no
  hook is intended. Restart the API service after config changes.

Pairing request missing from `list-requests`
: Agent may have failed mid-pairing (run `sudo ctrl-exec-agent request-pairing`
  to retry). Stale requests older than 10 minutes are cleaned automatically.
  Check ctrl-exec syslog for `ACTION=pair-request`.

Cert renewal not occurring
: Renewal is triggered by ping. Check `CERT EXPIRY` in ping output.
  Check ctrl-exec syslog for `ACTION=renew` and `ERR` lines.

Connection blocked unexpectedly (`ACTION=rate-block` in syslog)
: The agent has rate-limited the source IP. The volume threshold (default: 10
  connections in 60 seconds) can be triggered by the integration test suite or
  rapid repeated pings. The block expires automatically (default: 5 minutes for
  volume, 1 hour for probe). To clear immediately, reload the agent:
  `sudo systemctl reload ctrl-exec-agent` (rate limit state is held in memory
  and reset on SIGHUP). To disable rate limiting during testing, set
  `rate_limit_disable = 1` in `agent.conf` and reload. Remove it before
  returning to production use.


## Uninstalling

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --uninstall
```

Config, certs, and the agent registry are preserved. To remove everything:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/ctrl-exec-agent /etc/ctrl-exec
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/ctrl-exec /opt/ctrl-exec-scripts
# Debian
sudo userdel ctrl-exec-agent && sudo groupdel ctrl-exec
# Alpine
sudo deluser ctrl-exec-agent && sudo delgroup ctrl-exec
```
