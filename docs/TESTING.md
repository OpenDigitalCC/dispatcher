# Dispatcher - Testing Guide

Dispatcher has two levels of testing: unit tests that run entirely on the
control host without any network or agent involvement, and integration tests
that require at least one live paired agent.

Unit tests use `prove` and are safe to run at any time. Integration tests use
bash scripts and exercise real dispatcher-to-agent traffic over mTLS.

Manual checks that cannot be automated are documented separately in
`doc/MANUAL-CHECKS.md`.


## Unit Tests

Unit tests live in `t/` and test library modules directly. They require no
agents, no network, and no system services.

```bash
# Run all unit tests
prove -Ilib t/

# Run a single file
prove -Ilib t/rotation.t

# Verbose output
prove -Ilib -v t/auth.t
```

Each test file corresponds to one module:

| Test file | Module under test |
| --- | --- |
| `t/agent-config.t` | `Dispatcher::Agent::Config` |
| `t/auth.t` | `Dispatcher::Auth` |
| `t/auth-hook.t` | `Dispatcher::Auth` (hook exit codes and env) |
| `t/lock.t` | `Dispatcher::Lock` |
| `t/log.t` | `Dispatcher::Log` |
| `t/output.t` | `Dispatcher::Output` |
| `t/pairing-csr.t` | `Dispatcher::Agent::Pairing` (key/CSR/nonce) |
| `t/pairing-dispatcher.t` | `Dispatcher::Pairing` (queue/stale expiry) |
| `t/rate-limit.t` | `Dispatcher::Agent::RateLimit` |
| `t/registry.t` | `Dispatcher::Registry` |
| `t/registry-serial.t` | `Dispatcher::Registry` (serial tracking fields) |
| `t/renewal.t` | `Dispatcher::Engine` (cert renewal logic) |
| `t/rotation.t` | `Dispatcher::Rotation` |
| `t/serial-normalisation.t` | `Dispatcher::Agent::Pairing::serial_to_hex` |
| `t/update-dispatcher-serial.t` | `bin/update-dispatcher-serial` |

The `dispatcher-cli.t` and `engine.t` files cover CLI argument parsing and
dispatch logic respectively. `lock-holder.pl` is a test helper used by
`lock.t` to hold a lock in an independent process - it is not a test file.


## Integration Tests

Integration tests live in `t/integration/` and run real dispatcher commands
against live agents. They require a working dispatcher installation, at least
one paired agent, and the test scripts installed on each agent.

The tests are numbered and run in order. Each file is self-contained and can
also be run individually.


### Prerequisites

**1. Paired agents**

At least one agent must be registered and reachable. Two agents are needed for
parallel and multi-host tests; files that require two agents skip gracefully
when only one is available.

```bash
sudo dispatcher list-agents
sudo dispatcher ping <agent>
```

**2. Rate limiter raised**

The suite fires more than 10 connections to each agent, which exceeds the
default `volume_limit` and triggers a 5-minute block mid-suite. Before running,
disable rate limiting on every agent:

```bash
# On each agent host
echo "disable_rate_limit = 1" >> /etc/dispatcher-agent/agent.conf
systemctl reload dispatcher-agent   # or: /etc/init.d/dispatcher-agent reload
```

Remove the setting and reload when testing is complete. Rate-limit behaviour
itself is covered by `t/rate-limit.t` (unit) and `13-rate-limit-integration.sh`
(manual integration test, see below).

**3. Test scripts installed on each agent**

The integration tests call scripts by name via the dispatcher. These scripts
must exist in the agent's allowlist. Install them by running
`setup-agent-scripts.sh` on each agent host:

```bash
# Copy the script to the agent and run it as root
sudo bash t/integration/setup-agent-scripts.sh
```

This writes test scripts to `/opt/dispatcher-scripts/`, appends entries to
`/etc/dispatcher-agent/scripts.conf`, and sends SIGHUP to reload the allowlist.
It is safe to run multiple times.

Scripts installed:

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `env-dump` | Prints environment; confirms execution |
| `args-echo` | Echoes `argc` and each argument; used in argument tests |
| `exit-code` | Exits with the code passed as `$1`; used in exit code tests |
| `context-dump` | Reads stdin and echoes it; confirms JSON context forwarding |
| `big-output` | Produces N lines of output (default 500); used for output tests |
| `sleep-test` | Sleeps 30 seconds; used for lock tests |
| `lock-test` | Sleeps for `$1` seconds while holding a lock |
| `sleep-5` | Sleeps 5 seconds; completes within the default 10s timeout |
| `sleep-15` | Sleeps 15 seconds; triggers the 10s read timeout |
| `sleep-90` | Sleeps 90 seconds; completes within a 120s timeout |
| `daemonise-test` | Forks a background job and returns immediately |
| `allowlist-reload-check` | Added manually by test 09 to verify SIGHUP reload |
| `update-dispatcher-serial` | Serial update script; must be in allowlist for cert rotation |


### Running the Suite

```bash
# Full suite
sudo bash t/integration/run-tests.sh

# Specific files only
sudo bash t/integration/run-tests.sh 01-security-boundary.sh 02-argument-integrity.sh

# Single file directly
sudo bash t/integration/01-security-boundary.sh
```

The runner discovers agents automatically via `dispatcher list-agents` and
pings each one before the suite begins. No agent names are hardcoded.

Output shows pass/fail/skip for each assertion within a file, followed by a
summary table at the end:

```
============================================================
Test file                         PASS  FAIL  SKIP  Status
--------------------------------  ----  ----  ----  ------
security-boundary                   19     0     0  PASS
argument-integrity                  43     0     0  PASS
...
Suite complete: 12 test files passed, 0 failed
============================================================
```

Exit code is 0 if all files passed, 1 if any failed.

The runner also monitors for rate-limit symptoms. If three or more consecutive
"no response from child" errors appear, a warning is printed identifying the
likely cause and the fix.


### Test Files

| File | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `01-security-boundary.sh` | Allowlist enforcement, script name validation, metacharacter rejection |
| `02-argument-integrity.sh` | Argument passing: spaces, quotes, metacharacters, path traversal, large arg lists |
| `03-partial-failure.sh` | Mixed success/failure across hosts, exit code propagation |
| `04-json-output.sh` | `--json` output structure for run, ping, and multi-host operations |
| `05-parallelism.sh` | Concurrent dispatch to multiple agents completes within expected time |
| `06-auth-context.sh` | Username, token, and reqid forwarded correctly to agent and script |
| `07-concurrency-lock.sh` | Lock conflicts detected and reported; second run completes after lock releases |
| `08-auth-hook.sh` | Auth hook called; exit codes respected (requires SSH to agent) |
| `09-allowlist-reload.sh` | New allowlist entry active after SIGHUP without restart (requires SSH) |
| `10-timeout-behaviour.sh` | Read timeout fires for slow scripts; long-running scripts complete within extended timeout |
| `11-api-status.sh` | API `/run`, `/ping`, `/status/{reqid}`, 404 on unknown reqid, multi-host result storage |
| `12-serial-check.sh` | Serial check on `/ping` and `/run`; 403 when serial file absent (requires SSH) |

Files that require SSH to the agent host skip gracefully when SSH is not
available, reporting `SKIP` rather than `FAIL`.


### Environment Variables

`DISPATCHER`
: Dispatcher binary name or path. Default: `dispatcher`. Override if the
  binary is not in PATH or you want to test a specific build.

`AGENT_SSH_USER`
: SSH username for tests that require remote access to agent hosts (files 08,
  09, 12). Default: `root`. Set to the appropriate user if root SSH is
  disabled.

`API_HOST`, `API_PORT`, `API_SCHEME`
: API server address for file 11. Defaults: `localhost`, `7445`, `http`.

`CURL_OPTS`
: Options passed to `curl` in API tests. Default: `-s -f`.


### Rate-Limit Integration Test (manual)

`13-rate-limit-integration.sh` is not included in the standard suite because
it deliberately triggers a 5-minute agent block. Run it separately after
restoring the default `volume_limit` on the agent (i.e. with
`disable_rate_limit` removed):

```bash
sudo bash t/integration/13-rate-limit-integration.sh
```

This verifies end-to-end rate-limit behaviour: block triggers at the threshold,
subsequent connections fail with the expected error, block expires and
connections recover.


## Install-Time Testing

The installer supports a `--run-tests` flag that runs the full unit test suite
against the installed files immediately after installation. This is the
recommended way to verify a new installation or upgrade.

```bash
sudo bash install.sh --dispatcher --run-tests
sudo bash install.sh --agent --run-tests
```

What `--run-tests` does:

- Checks that `prove` is available (from `libtest-simple-perl` on Debian)
- Runs `prove -Ilib t/` against the installed source tree
- Exits non-zero if any tests fail, causing the installer to report failure

The integration tests are not run by `--run-tests` because they require live
agents that are not available at install time. Run them separately once agents
are paired and test scripts are installed.

If `prove` is not installed, the installer prints the install command and
skips the tests rather than failing:

```
prove not found - install with: apt install libtest-simple-perl
Skipping unit tests.
```


## Test Library (`t/integration/lib.sh`)

All integration test files source `lib.sh`, which provides:

Agent discovery
: `discover_agents` queries `dispatcher list-agents`, pings each registered
  agent, and exports `AGENTS` (all reachable), `AGENT1` (first), `AGENT2`
  (second). Called once by the runner before any test files run; test files
  call it automatically when run standalone.

`require_agents <n>`
: Skips the entire test file if fewer than `n` agents are reachable. Place
  near the top of any file that needs a minimum agent count.

`assert_agents_reachable`
: Pings all `AGENTS` and stops if any have gone away since the suite started.
  Call this before each `describe` block in files that run multiple dispatches.
  In non-interactive mode (as in the runner), stops immediately on agent loss
  and prints a rate-limit diagnosis if the failure pattern matches.

`run_dispatcher <args...>`
: Wrapper around `sudo dispatcher`. Sets `OUT`, `ERR`, and `RC`. Increments
  per-agent and total connection counters. Calls `_check_rate_warning` after
  each invocation to detect rate-block patterns.

`describe <label>`, `pass <label>`, `fail <label> [detail]`, `skip <label> [reason]`
: Test output helpers. `fail` accepts an optional second argument for
  additional context printed below the failure line.

`summary`
: Prints the `Results: N passed, N failed, N skipped` line and returns 1 if
  any failures. Call once at the end of every test file.

Assertion helpers
: `assert_exit`, `assert_contains`, `assert_not_contains`, `assert_json_valid`,
  `assert_json_field`. See `lib.sh` for full signatures.

Connection tracking
: `_CONN_TOTAL` counts total `run_dispatcher` calls in the current process.
  Per-agent counts are stored in `_CONN_AGENT_<name>`. Used by `_check_rate_warning`
  to report the connection count at which rate-limit symptoms begin.


## Writing New Integration Tests

### Naming and placement

Name new files `NN-description.sh` where `NN` continues the existing sequence.
Place them in `t/integration/`. Add the filename to the `TESTS` array in
`run-tests.sh` to include it in the default suite run.

Tests that must be run manually (because they have destructive side-effects,
require special setup, or take a long time) should not be added to the `TESTS`
array. Document them in the file's header comment and in `MANUAL-CHECKS.md`.

### File structure

Every test file follows this structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# NN-description.sh
#
# One-line summary of what this file tests.
#
# Requires: N reachable agent(s) minimum.
# Scripts needed: script-name-1, script-name-2.
# SSH required: yes/no (and why, if yes).

set -uo pipefail
source "${_LIB_DIR:-$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)}/lib.sh"

require_agents 1   # or 2 for multi-host tests

# ============================================================
assert_agents_reachable
describe "Short description of this group of assertions"
# ============================================================

run_dispatcher run "$AGENT1" script-name

assert_exit 0 "$RC" "clean exit"
assert_contains "$OUT" "expected output" "output contains expected string"

# ... more describe/assert blocks ...

summary
```

`set -uo pipefail` is required. `source lib.sh` must be the first non-comment
line after the set. `summary` must be the last line.

### Grouping assertions

Each `describe` block represents one logical scenario. Put an
`assert_agents_reachable` call before each block that dispatches to a live
agent - this ensures the test stops cleanly if the agent becomes unreachable
mid-suite rather than producing a cascade of confusing failures.

### SSH-gated blocks

Some tests require modifying agent-side state (config files, service reload)
and can only run if the test host can SSH to the agent. Use this pattern:

```bash
_SSH_USER="${AGENT_SSH_USER:-root}"
if ! ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=3 \
        "${_SSH_USER}@${AGENT1}" true 2>/dev/null; then
    skip "Test description" \
        "cannot reach $AGENT1 via SSH as $_SSH_USER - set AGENT_SSH_USER or run locally"
    summary
    exit 0
fi

# SSH is available - proceed with the test
ssh "${_SSH_USER}@${AGENT1}" "sudo systemctl reload dispatcher-agent"
```

Always restore any state changed via SSH (config edits, service reloads) in a
trap or at the end of the block, so a test failure does not leave the agent in
a modified state.

### Counting connections

The rate limiter triggers at 10 connections per source IP within 60 seconds
(default). When writing a new test file, count the number of `run_dispatcher`
calls. If a single file sends more than 8-9 calls to the same agent, either
spread them across both agents using `"${AGENTS[@]}"`, or document that
`disable_rate_limit = 1` must be set before running the suite.

The connection counters in `lib.sh` will detect and warn about rate-block
symptoms automatically, but a well-designed test file should not rely on the
warning - it should stay within the threshold.

### Skipping vs failing

Use `skip` when a prerequisite is not available (fewer agents than needed, no
SSH access, API not running). Use `fail` when the system behaved unexpectedly.
A skipped test does not count as a failure and does not affect the file's exit
code. Excessive skips in the summary table indicate missing prerequisites, not
bugs.

### New scripts on agents

If a new test needs a script that does not already exist on agents, add it to
`setup-agent-scripts.sh`. Follow the existing pattern: write the script with
`cat > "$SCRIPT_DIR/name.sh" << 'EOF'`, set permissions with `chmod 0755`,
and add the allowlist entry with `append_if_missing`.

Document the new script in the scripts table in this guide.


## Writing New Unit Tests

Unit tests use Perl's `Test::More`. Follow the existing files for structure.
The key conventions for this codebase:

Named parameters
: All public module functions use named parameters (`%opts` or `my (%opts) =
  @_`). Test calls must pass parameter names: `Registry::register_agent(hostname
  => 'host-01', ip => '10.0.0.1', ...)` not positional.

Private functions
: Private functions are prefixed `_` and are not part of the public API. Test
  them via the public interface where possible. Where the private function
  contains complex logic worth testing directly (as with `_serial_to_hex`),
  import it explicitly or call it as `Dispatcher::Module::_function_name`.

Temporary directories
: Use `File::Temp::tempdir(CLEANUP => 1)` for tests that write files. Pass the
  temp dir as the relevant path parameter (e.g. `registry_dir => $tmpdir`).
  Never write to system paths in tests.

Test count declaration
: Declare the expected number of assertions with `use Test::More tests => N`
  or use `done_testing()` at the end. Undeclared counts make it harder to spot
  accidentally skipped assertions.

Reading source before writing tests
: Always read the current module source before writing tests for it. Verify
  parameter names, calling convention (named vs positional), and whether a
  function is public or private. The majority of test bugs in this codebase
  have been caused by assumptions about parameter names that did not match the
  actual module interface.
