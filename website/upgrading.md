# Upgrade Procedure

The general upgrade procedure for all versions:

1. Review the section below for your version boundary. Note any breaking changes or migration steps before proceeding.

2. Back up state directories:
   ```bash
   sudo cp -a /etc/ctrl-exec /etc/ctrl-exec.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)
   sudo cp -a /var/lib/ctrl-exec /var/lib/ctrl-exec.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

3. Pull the new version:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ctrl-exec
   git pull
   ```

4. Run the installer for each role:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh --ctrl-exec
   # on each agent host:
   sudo ./install.sh --agent
   ```

5. Restart services:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ctrl-exec-api
   sudo systemctl restart ctrl-exec-agent
   ```

6. Verify:
   ```bash
   ced --version
   ced ping <hostname>
   ```
