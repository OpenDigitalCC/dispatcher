`cea` is the shortcut for `ctrl-exec-agent`. All commands below work with either name.

# serve

```
ctrl-exec-agent serve [--config <path>]
```

Starts the agent daemon. Listens on the configured port (default: 7443) for incoming mTLS connections from ctrl-exec. Runs in the foreground — use systemd or procd for service management in production.

```bash
ctrl-exec-agent serve
ctrl-exec-agent serve --config /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.conf
```

The agent reloads its configuration and allowlist on SIGHUP without restarting:

```bash
sudo systemctl kill --signal=HUP ctrl-exec-agent
```

# request-pairing

```
ctrl-exec-agent request-pairing --dispatcher <hostname> [--port <n>] [--background] [--timeout <s>]
```

Generates a key pair and CSR, connects to the ctrl-exec pairing port, and waits for approval. On approval, stores the signed certificate, CA certificate, and ctrl-exec serial.

`--dispatcher <hostname>`
: Hostname or IP of the ctrl-exec instance. Required.

`--port <n>`
: Pairing port on the ctrl-exec host. Default: 7444.

`--background`
: Prints the request ID and pairing code to stdout, then waits without requiring an interactive terminal. Suitable for automated or orchestrated pairing.

`--timeout <s>`
: Seconds to wait for approval before timing out. Default: 600 (10 minutes).

```bash
sudo ctrl-exec-agent request-pairing --dispatcher ctrl-exec.example.com
sudo ctrl-exec-agent request-pairing --dispatcher ctrl-exec.example.com --background
sudo ctrl-exec-agent request-pairing --dispatcher ctrl-exec.example.com --background --timeout 300
```

Both terminals display a 6-digit verification code derived from the CSR content. Verify the codes match before approving on the ctrl-exec side. A mismatch indicates the CSR was substituted or the request was misrouted.

# self-ping

```
ctrl-exec-agent self-ping
```

Connects to `127.0.0.1:7443` using the agent's own certificate. Confirms the port is listening and mTLS is functional.

The expected response is `403 serial mismatch`. The agent's own certificate is not a ctrl-exec certificate, and the agent correctly rejects it. This is the success case — it confirms the serial check is active. Any other result indicates a configuration problem.

# self-check

```
ctrl-exec-agent self-check
```

Validates the agent configuration without making any network connections. Checks certificate files exist and are readable, configuration keys are valid, and allowlist entries point to existing paths.

Run before reloading to verify a configuration change will not break the running agent:

```bash
ctrl-exec-agent self-check && \
    sudo systemctl kill --signal=HUP ctrl-exec-agent
```

# pairing-status

```
ctrl-exec-agent pairing-status
```

Shows the agent's current certificate, expiry date, and the stored ctrl-exec serial number.

```
Certificate:  /etc/ctrl-exec-agent/agent.crt
Serial:       0A:1B:2C:3D
Expiry:       Mar 16 12:00:00 2027 GMT
ctrl-exec serial: 4E:5F:6A:7B
```

Use after a ctrl-exec cert rotation to confirm the agent has received the new serial.

# Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Configuration or runtime error |
| `2` | Pairing failed or timed out |
