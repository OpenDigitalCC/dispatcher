# Log Format

All log lines follow `ACTION=value KEY=value KEY=value` with `ACTION` always first. Values containing spaces are quoted. Syslog facility is `daemon` throughout.

Syslog tags:

- `ctrl-exec-dispatcher` — emitted by both `ced` and `ctrl-exec-api`
- `ctrl-exec-agent` — emitted by `cea`

Every operation generates a 16-character cryptographically random request ID (`REQID`). The same `REQID` appears in both the ctrl-exec and agent log entries for the same operation, enabling cross-host correlation:

```bash
grep 'REQID=a1b2c3d4' /var/log/syslog
```

To filter to WARNING and above:

```bash
journalctl -u ctrl-exec-agent -p warning
journalctl -u ctrl-exec-dispatcher -p warning
```

# Field Glossary

`ACTION`
: Always present. The event type. Always the first field.

`AGENT`
: Agent hostname as recorded in the registry.

`AUTHACTION`
: The action passed to the auth hook (`run`, `ping`, `api`).

`BIND`
: Address the API server bound to.

`BYTES`
: Number of bytes consumed before timeout.

`COUNT`
: Number of entries evicted from the rate limit table.

`DAYS_LEFT`
: Days of certificate validity remaining at the time of a cert check.

`ERROR`
: Error message. Quoted if it contains spaces.

`EXPIRY`
: Certificate expiry date in OpenSSL format.

`EXIT`
: Script exit code. `0` = success; positive = script failure; `-1` = ctrl-exec-side failure; `126` = exec failed or killed by signal.

`HOSTS`
: Comma-separated list of target hosts for this dispatch.

`IP`
: Source IP address of the caller.

`LEN`
: Request body length in bytes.

`METHOD`
: HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`).

`MSG`
: Human-readable description of a config warning.

`NEW_SERIAL`
: The new ctrl-exec certificate serial after rotation.

`OLD_SERIAL`
: The previous ctrl-exec certificate serial.

`OVERLAP_EXPIRES`
: Unix timestamp after which agents that have not confirmed the new serial are marked stale.

`PATH`
: HTTP request path, or filesystem path for config warnings.

`PEER`
: IP address of the connecting peer.

`PORT`
: Listening port.

`REASON`
: Short reason code for a denial or block. Values include `queue-full`, `volume`, `probe`, `not-in-allowlist`, `hook-denied`, `hook-not-executable`.

`REQID`
: 16-character cryptographically random request ID. Present on all run, ping, and pairing events. Identical in both ctrl-exec and agent log entries for the same operation.

`RESULT`
: Auth hook outcome: `allow`, `deny`, `deny-credentials`, `deny-privilege`, or `error`.

`RTT`
: Round-trip time for the operation, including connection setup and script execution.

`SCRIPT`
: Script name as specified in the allowlist.

`SERIAL`
: Certificate serial number.

`STATUS`
: Ping status (`ok` or `error`), or pairing state (`pending`).

`TARGET`
: Agent hostname targeted by a run or ping.

`THRESHOLD`
: Cert renewal threshold in days.

`TLS`
: `1` if the API server is listening with TLS; `0` otherwise.

`USER`
: Username from the request context, as forwarded to the auth hook.

# Alert Patterns

## Security Events

| Pattern | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `ACTION=rate-block REASON=volume` | Investigate source IP for connection flooding |
| `ACTION=rate-block REASON=probe` | Investigate source IP for TLS probing |
| `ACTION=serial-reject` | Check rotation broadcast status — run `ced serial-status` |
| `ACTION=revoked-cert` | Treat as a security event — investigate source IP immediately |
| `ACTION=ip-block` | Review `allowed_ips` config — investigate unexpected sources |
| `ACTION=deny` repeated from same PEER | Check agent allowlist — may indicate misconfiguration or probing |

## Rotation Events

| Pattern | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `ACTION=serial-stale` | Re-pair the agent |
| `ACTION=serial-broadcast-fail` repeated for same agent | Check connectivity — agent will be marked stale after overlap window expires |
| `ACTION=cert-rotation-fail` | Investigate immediately — rotation retried on next check interval |
| All agents returning `ACTION=serial-reject` after rotation | Run `ced serial-status` and `ced rotate-cert` |

## Configuration Problems

| Pattern | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `ACTION=config-warn` | Review `agent.conf` — fix the offending entry |
| `ACTION=accept-fatal` | Agent will stop serving — investigate and restart immediately |
| `ACTION=auth RESULT=error REASON=hook-not-executable` | Fix hook path and permissions — all requests are failing |
